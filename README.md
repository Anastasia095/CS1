# Code Examples Repository for CS1 with Meade

This repository is dedicated to hosting code examples that were originally posted on webcourses and labs. It also includes some of the class examples. Please note that while I've made every effort to replicate the class examples accurately, there's no guarantee that they are perfectly copied. Some of the programs from the class examples may be incomplete or require modifications.
