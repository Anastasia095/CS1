# Code Examples Repository for CS1 with Meade

This repository is dedicated to hosting code examples that were originally posted on webcourses and labs. It also includes some of the class examples. Just a heads up, while I've done my best to copy things accurately, there's no guarantee they're perfect. Some class examples might be a bit wonky, incomplete or need some tweaking.
